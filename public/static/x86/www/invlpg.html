<h1>INVLPG -- Invalidate TLB Entry</h1>
<h2>Short description</h2>
<p> Invalidates (flushes) the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) entry specified with the source operand.</p>
<h2>Long description</h2>
<p> Invalidates (flushes) the translation lookaside buffer (TLB) entry specified with the source operand. The source operand is a memory address. The processor determines the page that contains that address and flushes the TLB entry for that page. The INVLPG instruction is a privileged instruction. When the processor is running in protected mode, the CPL must be 0 to execute this instruction. The INVLPG instruction normally flushes the TLB entry only for the specified page; however, in some cases, it may flush more entries, even the entire TLB. The instruction is guaranteed to invalidates only TLB entries associated with the current PCID. (If PCIDs are disabled  CR4.PCIDE = 0  the current PCID is 000H.) The instruction also invalidates any global TLB entries for the specified page, regardless of PCID. For more details on operations that flush the TLB, see “MOVMove to/from Control Registers” and Section 4.10.4.1, “Operations that Invalidate TLBs and Paging-Structure Caches,” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A. This instructions operation is the same in all non-64-bit modes. It also operates the same in 64-bit mode, except if the memory address is in non-canonical form. In this case, INVLPG is the same as a NOP.</p>
