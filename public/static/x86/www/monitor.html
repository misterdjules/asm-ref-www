<h1>MONITOR -- Set Up Monitor Address</h1>
<h2>Short description</h2>
<p> The MONITOR instruction arms address monitoring hardware using an address specified in EAX (the address range that the monitoring hardware checks for store operations can be determined by using CPUID).</p>
<h2>Long description</h2>
<p> The MONITOR instruction arms address monitoring hardware using an address specified in EAX (the address range that the monitoring hardware checks for store operations can be determined by using CPUID). A store to an address within the specified address range triggers the monitoring hardware. The state of monitor hardware is used by MWAIT. The content of EAX is an effective address (in 64-bit mode, RAX is used). By default, the DS segment is used to create a linear address that is monitored. Segment overrides can be used. ECX and EDX are also used. They communicate other information to MONITOR. ECX specifies optional extensions. EDX specifies optional hints; it does not change the architectural behavior of the instruction. For the Pentium 4 processor (family 15, model 3), no extensions or hints are defined. Undefined hints in EDX are ignored by the processor; undefined extensions in ECX raises a general protection fault. The address range must use memory of the write-back type. Only write-back memory will correctly trigger the monitoring hardware. Additional information on determining what address range to use in order to prevent false wake-ups is described in Chapter 8, “Multiple-Processor Management” of the Intel® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer’s Manual, Volume 3A. The MONITOR instruction is ordered as a load operation with respect to other memory transactions. The instruction is subject to the permission checking and faults associated with a byte load. Like a load, MONITOR sets the A-bit but not the D-bit in page tables. CPUID.01H:ECX.MONITOR[bit 3] indicates the availability of MONITOR and MWAIT in the processor. When set, MONITOR may be executed only at privilege level 0 (use at any other privilege level results in an invalid-opcode exception). The operating system or system BIOS may disable this instruction by using the IA32_MISC_ENABLE MSR; disabling MONITOR clears the CPUID feature flag and causes execution to generate an invalid-opcode exception. The instruction’s operation is the same in non-64-bit modes and 64-bit mode.</p>
