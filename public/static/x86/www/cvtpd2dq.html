<h1>CVTPD2DQ -- Convert Packed Double-Precision FP Values to Packed Dword Integers</h1>
<h2>Short description</h2>
<p> Converts two packed double-precision floating-point values in the source operand (second operand) to two packed signed doubleword integers in the destination operand (first operand).</p>
<h2>Long description</h2>
<p> Converts two packed double-precision floating-point values in the source operand (second operand) to two packed signed doubleword integers in the destination operand (first operand). The source operand can be an XMM register or a 128-bit memory location. The destination operand is an XMM register. The result is stored in the low quadword of the destination operand and the high quadword is cleared to all 0s. When a conversion is inexact, the value returned is rounded according to the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register. If a converted result is larger than the maximum signed doubleword integer, the floating-point invalid exception is raised, and if this exception is masked, the indefinite integer value (80000000H) is returned. In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15). 128-bit Legacy SSE version: The source operand is an XMM register or 128- bit memory location. The destination operation is an XMM register. Bits[127:64] of the destination XMM register are zeroed. However, the upper bits (VLMAX-1:128) of the corresponding YMM register destination are unmodified. VEX.128 encoded version: The source operand is an XMM register or 128- bit memory location. The destination operation is a YMM register. The upper bits (VLMAX-1:64) of the corresponding YMM register destination are zeroed. VEX.256 encoded version: The source operand is a YMM register or 256- bit memory location. The destination operation is an XMM register. The upper bits (255:128) of the corresponding YMM register destination are zeroed. Note: In VEX-encoded versions, VEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD.</p>
