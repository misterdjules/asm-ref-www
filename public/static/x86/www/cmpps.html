<h1>CMPPS -- Compare Packed Single-Precision Floating-Point Values</h1>
<h2>Short description</h2>
<p> Performs a SIMD compare of the packed single-precision floating-point values in the source operand (second operand) and the destination operand (first operand) and returns the results of the comparison to the destination operand.</p>
<h2>Long description</h2>
<p> Performs a SIMD compare of the packed single-precision floating-point values in the source operand (second operand) and the destination operand (first operand) and returns the results of the comparison to the destination operand. The comparison predicate operand (third operand) specifies the type of comparison performed on each of the pairs of packed values. The result of each comparison is a doubleword mask of all 1s (comparison true) or all 0s (comparison false). The sign of zero is ignored for comparisons, so that 0.0 is equal to �0.0. 128-bit Legacy SSE version: The first source and destination operand (first operand) is an XMM register. The second source operand (second operand) can be an XMM register or 128-bit memory location. The comparison predicate operand is an 8-bit immediate, bits 2:0 of the immediate define the type of comparison to be performed (see Table 3-7). Bits 7:3 of the immediate is reserved. Bits (VLMAX-1:128) of the corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged. Four comparisons are performed with results written to bits 127:0 of the destination operand. The unordered relationship is true when at least one of the two source operands being compared is a NaN; the ordered relationship is true when neither source operand is a NaN. A subsequent computational instruction that uses the mask result in the destination operand as an input operand will not generate a fault, because a mask of all 0s corresponds to a floating-point value of �0.0 and a mask of all 1s corresponds to a QNaN. Note that processors with CPUID.1H:ECX.AVX =0 do not implement the greater-than, greater-than-or-equal, not-greater than, and not-greater-than-or-equal relations predicates. These comparisons can be made either by using the inverse relationship (that is, use the not-less-than-or-equal to make a greater-than comparison) or by using software emulation. When using software emulation, the program must swap the operands (copying registers when necessary to protect the data that will now be in the destination), and then perform the compare using a different predicate. The predicate to be used for these emulations is listed in Table 3-7 under the heading Emulation. Compilers and assemblers may implement the following two-operand pseudo-ops in addition to the three-operand CMPPS instruction, for processors with CPUID.1H:ECX.AVX =0. See Table 3-11. Compiler should treat reserved Imm8 values as illegal syntax. In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15).</p>
