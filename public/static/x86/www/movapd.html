<h1>MOVAPD -- Move Aligned Packed Double-Precision Floating-Point Values</h1>
<h2>Short description</h2>
<p> Moves 2 or 4 double-precision floating-point values from the source operand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand).</p>
<h2>Long description</h2>
<p> Moves 2 or 4 double-precision floating-point values from the source operand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand). This instruction can be used to load an XMM or YMM register from an 128-bit or 256-bit memory location, to store the contents of an XMM or YMM register into a 128-bit or 256-bit memory location, or to move data between two XMM or two YMM registers. When the source or destination operand is a memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 16-byte (128-bit version) or 32-byte (VEX.256 encoded version) boundary or a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated. To move double-precision floating-point values to and from unaligned memory locations, use the (V)MOVUPD instruction. In 64-bit mode, use of the REX.R prefix permits this instruction to access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15). 128-bit versions: Moves 128 bits of packed double-precision floating-point values from the source operand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand). This instruction can be used to load an XMM register from a 128-bit memory location, to store the contents of an XMM register into a 128-bit memory location, or to move data between two XMM registers. When the source or destination operand is a memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary or a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated. To move single-precision floating-point values to and from unaligned memory locations, use the VMOVUPD instruction. 128-bit Legacy SSE version: Bits (VLMAX-1:128) of the corresponding YMM destination register remain unchanged. VEX.128 encoded version: Bits (VLMAX-1:128) of the destination YMM register destination are zeroed. VEX.256 encoded version: Moves 256 bits of packed double-precision floating-point values from the source operand (second operand) to the destination operand (first operand). This instruction can be used to load a YMM register from a 256-bit memory location, to store the contents of a YMM register into a 256-bit memory location, or to move data between two YMM registers. When the source or destination operand is a memory operand, the operand must be aligned on a 32-byte boundary or a general-protection exception (#GP) will be generated. To move single-precision floating-point values to and from unaligned memory locations, use the VMOVUPD instruction.</p>
