<h1>CVTSS2SI -- Convert Scalar Single-Precision FP Value to Dword Integer</h1>
<h2>Short description</h2>
<p> Converts a single-precision floating-point value in the source operand (second operand) to a signed doubleword integer (or signed quadword integer if operand size is 64 bits) in the destination operand (first operand).</p>
<h2>Long description</h2>
<p> Converts a single-precision floating-point value in the source operand (second operand) to a signed doubleword integer (or signed quadword integer if operand size is 64 bits) in the destination operand (first operand). The source operand can be an XMM register or a memory location. The destination operand is a general-purpose register. When the source operand is an XMM register, the single-precision floating-point value is contained in the low doubleword of the register. When a conversion is inexact, the value returned is rounded according to the rounding control bits in the MXCSR register. If a converted result is larger than the maximum signed doubleword integer, the floating-point invalid exception is raised, and if this exception is masked, the indefinite integer value (80000000H) is returned. In 64-bit mode, the instruction can access additional registers (XMM8-XMM15, R8-R15) when used with a REX.R prefix. Use of the REX.W prefix promotes the instruction to 64-bit operands. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits. Legacy SSE instructions: In 64-bit mode, Use of the REX.W prefix promotes the instruction to 64-bit operands. See the summary chart at the beginning of this section for encoding data and limits. Note: In VEX-encoded versions, VEX.vvvv is reserved and must be 1111b, otherwise instructions will #UD.</p>
